# JMRITrainNode
TrainNode is a JMRI compatible I/O controller built on the MQTT protocol. Using the Raspberry Pi Pico, each node can support up to 16 turnouts as standard, or more with user addons.

Note: This repo is very much a work in progress, see [JMRITrainNode](https://github.com/nhjrobotics/JMRITrainNode) for a complete build for micropython.

## Required Hardware
This project uses the [Wiznet Ethernet Hat](https://docs.wiznet.io/Product/Open-Source-Hardware/wiznet_ethernet_hat) for the Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040), which is available at major retailers such as Core Electronics in Australia. This is used for networking.
